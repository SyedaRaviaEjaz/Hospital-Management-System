# Hospital-Management-System
Hospital management system is a console based program developed in c++ using DEV C++.

In the proposed system, we aimed to design an automatic-digital program which generates and manages patient records; it allows the user to add, update, search/locate and delete any records from the system. The user is able to view the record of a certain patient containing each and every detail concerning his treatment.

To access any kind of information to make changes or just view data, the user has to first verify his position. As the system contains a login system, it can only be accessed using the correct login information and password verification. The system maintains data security and integrity along with providing a solution to the hospital.
